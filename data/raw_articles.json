Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAfter laying off about 1,000 employees last week, Google is now cutting jobs on its advertising sales team. In a statement to The Verge, Google spokesperson Chris Pappas confirmed that “a few hundred roles globally are being eliminated” as part of the change.\n\nThe news of Google’s latest layoffs was first reported by Business Insider, which obtained a memo from Google senior vice president Philipp Schindler. Schindler reportedly hinted the layoffs will primarily affect its Large Customer Sales (LCS) unit, a team that sells ads to large businesses, while the Google Customer Solutions team (GCS), which sells ads to smaller clients, will become the “core” ad sales team instead. Google laid off some employees on its LCS team last October, according to a separate report from Business Insider.\n\n“Every year we go through a rigorous process to structure our team to provide the best service to our Ads customers,” Pappas tells The Verge. “We map customers to the right specialist teams and sales channels to meet their service needs. As part of this, a few hundred roles globally are being eliminated and impacted employees will be able to apply for open roles or elsewhere at Google.”\n\nThat tracks with a report from my colleague Alex Heath, who wrote in The Verge’s Command Line newsletter that last week’s layoffs wouldn’t be the end, adding that “the roughly 30,000-person ad sales group is another natural target.” Google has already made sweeping cuts across several parts of its company, affecting the employees working on Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest products as well as those on its engineering and Google Assistant teams.\n\nGoogle still hasn’t put a number on how many employees it has laid off this year. But with last week’s layoffs affecting “a few hundred” roles in each impacted division and this most recent round eliminating another “few hundred” jobs, the cuts have certainly climbed above 1,000.",

Google just confirmed to The Verge that it’s eliminated “a few hundred” roles in each of these divisions, meaning Google has confirmed layoffs of around a thousand employees on Wednesday alone, if we use a reasonable definition of “few.”\n\nAnd those are only the cuts we know about. We asked Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini to say if this was the complete and total number of job cuts in this round of layoffs, but she stopped replying at that point, only confirming existing layoff reports at 9to5Google and Semafor. The New York Times reported on the engineering team layoffs too.\n\nWhen we spoke to Mencini earlier this evening about the Google hardware layoffs, she did not mention the other layoffs — but did write that “a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better” and that “some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally.”\n\nSo there may be more, and it’s possible that Google is attempting to spread out the bad news instead of having it hit all at once.\n\nGoogle parent firm Alphabet employed 182,381 employees as of September 30th, 2023, so roughly a thousand job cuts would only be around half a percent of the company’s total. There’s a lot of tech layoffs going around.\n\nIf you know about more unreported layoffs, please tip us at tips@theverge.com.\n\nUpdate January 11th, 8:35AM ET: Removed speculation about the origin of other reports on Google’s layoffs.",

His coverage areas included audio, home theater, smartphones, and more.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nA year ago, Google started off 2024 with some layoffs. It hasn’t taken similar steps (yet) in 2025, but employees are fearing the worst. And if the Platforms and Devices team is anything to go by, there’s ample reason for concern. Google has distributed a memo to all US employees working on Android, Pixel hardware, and other projects that offers a “voluntary exit program” guaranteeing severance for anyone willing to step away from their role at the company. The memo went out from platforms and devices SVP Rick Osterloh, according to 9to5Google.\n\n“This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year,” Osterloh wrote. “There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts can often be a precursor to layoffs if not enough employees take Google up on its offer and choose to leave.\n\nGoogle combined its Android and hardware teams under Osterloh in April. Executives said the streamlined approach would help it integrate AI features across products and services more quickly.\n\nA few months later in October, Alphabet’s chief finance officer Anat Ashkenazi said she would prioritize “cost efficiencies” throughout the company. “There’s really good work that was done, started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to re-engineer the cost base,” she said during her first earnings call as CFO. “But I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities.” The cost-cutting measures are partly designed to offset Google pouring so much money into AI.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel phones have never come anywhere close to the sales numbers enjoyed by Apple and Samsung, but the company is at least trending in the right direction; Counterpoint Research reported that Google recorded its highest-ever quarterly sales volume for smartphones in Q3 2024.\n\nSome employees at Google have recently been circulating a petition that calls for CEO Sundar Pichai to offer exactly this type of optional buyout before resorting to involuntary layoffs. “Ongoing rounds of layoffs make us feel insecure about our jobs,” the petition said, according to CNBC. “The company is clearly in a strong financial position, making the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation hurt even more.”\n\nAt least for the time being, it appears the voluntary exit program hasn’t been extended to other divisions within Google like search or the DeepMind AI team.",

Share\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google has offered buyouts to another swath of its workforce across several key divisions in a fresh round of cost cutting coming ahead of a court decision that could order a breakup of its internet empire. The Mountain View, California, company confirmed the streamlining that was reported by several news outlets.\n\nIt’s not clear how many employees are affected, but the offers were made to staff in Google’s search, advertising, research and engineering units, according to The Wall Street Journal. Google employs most of the nearly 186,000 workers on the worldwide payroll of its parent company, Alphabet Inc.\n\n“Earlier this year, some of our teams introduced a voluntary exit program with severance for U.S.-based Googlers, and several more are now offering the program to support our important work ahead,” a Google spokesperson, Courtenay Mencini, said in a statement.\n\n“A number of teams are also asking remote employees who live near an office to return to a hybrid work schedule in order to bring folks more together in-person,” Mencini said.\n\nGoogle is offering the buyouts while awaiting for a federal judge to determine its fate after its ubiquitous search engine was declared an illegal monopoly as part of nearly 5-year-old case by the U.S. Justice Department. The company is also awaiting remedy action in another antitrust case involving its digital ad network.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is weighing a government proposal seeking to ban Google paying more than $26 billon annually to Apple and other technology companies to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for online information, require it to share data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. The judge is expected to rule before Labor Day, clearing the way for Google to pursue its plan to appeal last year’s decision that labeled its search engine as a monopoly.\n\nThe proposed dismantling coincides with ongoing efforts by the Justice Department to force Google to part with some of the technology powering the company’s digital ad network after a federal judge ruled that its digital ad network has been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.\n\nLike several of its peers in Big Tech, Google has been periodically reducing its headcount since 2023 as the industry began to backtrack from the hiring spree that was triggered during pandemic lockdowns that spurred feverish demand for digital services.\n\nGoogle began its post-pandemic retrenchment by laying off 12,000 workers in early 2023 and since then as been trimming some divisions to help bolster its profits while ramping up its spending on artificial intelligence — a technology driving an upheaval that is starting to transform its search engine into a more conversational answer engine.",

A handful of companies have been making job cuts in recent weeks, bringing uncertainty for workers across industries.\n\nIn the world of retail and tech, some of these cuts arrive after a ramp-up in hiring seen during the COVID-19 pandemic — when people spent more time and money online. Now, many companies are reducing their workforces to help lower costs and bolster their bottom lines.\n\nHere’s some tech and retail companies that have laid of employees of late:\n\nREI layoffs\n\nREI is laying off 357 workers, mostly in the outdoor retailer’s headquarters and distribution centers. In a letter to employees, CEO Eric Artz noted that “outdoor specialty retail has experienced four quarters of decline — and that trend has been worsening.” While REI was able to outperform this for much of last year, he said, this trend caught up to the company in the fourth quarter, and difficult conditions are expected in 2024.\n\nLevi’s layoffs\n\nLevi Strauss & Co. is slashing its global corporate workforce by 10% to 15% in the first half of the year — as part of a two-year restructuring plan that seeks to cut costs and simplify its operations, the denim giant said.

The job cuts — which represent about an 8% reduction of Microsoft’s 22,000-person gaming workforce — arrive just over three months since the tech giant completed its $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard.\n\nTikTok layoffs\n\nTikTok said its shedding dozens of workers in its advertising and sales unit. A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the social media platform is cutting 60 jobs. TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, did not provide a reason for the layoffs.\n\nRiot Games layoffs\n\nVideo game developer Riot Games, which is behind the popular “League of Legends” multiplayer battle game, is trimming 11% of its staff. The company, which is owned by Chinese technology giant Tencent, said 530 jobs were being eliminated.\n\neBay layoffs\n\nOnline retailer eBay Inc. will cut about 1,000 jobs, or an estimated 9% of its full-time workforce, saying its number of employees and costs have exceeded how much the business is growing in a slowing economy.\n\nWayfair layoffs\n\nOnline furniture seller Wayfair is cutting about 1,650 jobs, or 13% of its global workforce. The restructuring is set to reduce team sizes across the company and reduce seniority in certain roles with the company planning to “rebuild with modified leveling” this year, CEO and co-founder Niraj Shah said.\n\nMacy’s layoffs\n\nMacy’s is laying off about 3.5% of its total headcount, which amounts to roughly 2,350 employees.

Share\n\nLONDON (AP) — Google is laying off 12,000 workers, or about 6% of its workforce, becoming the latest tech company to trim staff as the economic boom that the industry rode during the COVID-19 pandemic ebbs.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, who also leads its parent company Alphabet, informed staff Friday at the Silicon Valley giant about the cuts in an email that was also posted on the company’s news blog.\n\nIt is the company’s biggest-ever round of layoffs and adds to tens of thousands of other job losses recently announced by Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta and other tech companies as they tighten their belts amid a darkening outlook for the industry. Just this month, there have been at least 48,000 job cuts announced by major companies in the sector.\n\n“Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth,” Pichai wrote. “To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.”\n\nHe said the layoffs reflect a “rigorous review” carried out by Google of its operations.\n\nThe jobs being eliminated “cut across Alphabet, product areas, functions, levels and regions,” Pichai said. He said he was “deeply sorry” for the layoffs.\n\nRegulatory filings illustrate how Google’s workforce swelled during the pandemic, ballooning to nearly 187,000 people by late last year from 119,000 at the end of 2019.\n\nPichai said that Google, founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, was “bound to go through difficult economic cycles.”\n\n“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” he wrote. He called out the company’s investments in artificial intelligence as an area of opportunity.\n\nThere will be job cuts in the U.S. and in other unspecified countries, according to Pichai’s letter.\n\nTech companies that “not long ago were the darlings of the stock market” have been forced to freeze hiring and cut jobs in preparation for an economic downturn, said a note from Victoria Scholar, an analyst with U.K.-based Interactive Investor.\n\n“Digital spending is suffering, and ad revenues are falling with it,” she wrote.\n\nJust this week, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts, or nearly 5% of its workforce. Amazon said this month it is cutting 18,000 jobs, although that’s a fraction of its 1.5 million strong workforce, while business software maker Salesforce is laying off about 8,000 employees, or 10% of the total. Last fall Facebook parent Meta announced it would shed 11,000 positions, or 13% of its workers. Elon Musk slashed jobs at Twitter after after he acquired the social media company last fall.\n\nThose job cuts are hitting smaller players as well. U.K.-based cybersecurity firm Sophos laid off 450 employees, or 10% of its global workforce. Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase cut 20% of its workforce, about 950 jobs, in its second round of layoffs in less than a year.\n\nEmployment in the U.S. has been resilient despite signs of a slowing economy, and there were another 223,000 jobs added in December. Yet the tech sector grew exceptionally fast over the last several years due to increased demand as employees began to work remotely.\n\nCEOs of a number of companies have taken blame for growing too fast, yet those same companies, even after the latest round of job cuts, remain much larger than they were before the economic boom from the pandemic began.\n\n“I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here,” Pichai wrote.\n\nWhile the tech layoffs are “shocking numbers,” their effect on tech industry employment is “nowhere near as bad as what it seems,” said John Blevins, an adjunct professor at Cornell University’s business school.\n\n“These workers who were laid off will readily get new jobs,” most likely at smaller tech companies, Blevins said. “They’re coming with high credentials from these big firms. That knowledge will be transferred and will actually work to everyone’s benefit.”\n\nIn their layoff announcements, both Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the importance of capitalizing on their advances in artificial intelligence technology, reflecting renewed competition between the tech giants sparked by Microsoft’s growing partnership with the San Francisco startup OpenAI.\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc., based in Mountain View, California, rose more than 4% Friday.\n\n—-\n\nAP Technology Writers Matt O’Brien and Michael Liedtke contributed to this report.",

We're continuing to support any impacted employees as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.\"\n\nThe firm made $76.3bn (£59.9bn) in revenue in the third quarter of 2023, according to its most recent figures, with a net income of $19.7bn.\n\nFitbit and Voice\n\nGoogle purchased Fitbit for $2.1bn in 2019 at a time when many tech businesses were expanding into other areas.\n\nBut now it has slashed jobs in the team - with Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman among those leaving the firm, according to multiple reports.\n\nOther major job cuts have come in the team working on Google Assistant, a voice-controlled technology similar to Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThese job losses are again understood to be measured in the hundreds.",

    "content": "Google parent Alphabet to cut 12,000 jobs\n\n20 January 2023 Share Save Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGoogle's parent company Alphabet will cut 12,000 jobs, in the latest staff redundancies to hit the tech industry.\n\nGoogle and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said he took \"full responsibility\" for the cuts, in an internal email.\n\nThe cuts will affect 6% of Alphabet's workforce worldwide, in teams including recruitment and engineering.\n\nThis comes days after Microsoft announced 10,000 jobs would be lost, and weeks after Amazon announced 18,000 job cuts.\n\nMr Pichai thanked staff for \"working so hard\" in their roles, adding that their \"contributions have been invaluable\".\n\nHe wrote: \"While this transition won't be easy, we're going to support employees as they look for their next opportunity.\n\n\"Until then, please take good care of yourselves as you absorb this difficult news. As part of that, if you are just starting your work day, please feel free to work from home today.\"\n\nAccording to a recent filing with Companies House, Google has more than 5,500 staff in the UK. But it is unclear how many of these will be affected by the cuts.\n\n'Unsustainable'\n\nMr Pichai announced severance packages for US employees, who will receive at least 16 weeks of salary, their 2022 bonus, paid vacations and six months of health coverage.\n\nHe said he remained \"optimistic about our ability to deliver on our mission, even on our toughest days\".\n\nWall Street welcomed the cuts - Alphabet shares rose by 3.5% in electronic trading before the stock market opened.\n\nAnalysts have said tech's big guns had previously overspent, not seeing a slowdown on the horizon.\n\nDaniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said the layoffs highlight irresponsible spending across a sector basking in \"hypergrowth\".\n\n\"The reality is tech stalwarts over-hired at a pace that was unsustainable and now darker macro is forcing these layoffs across the tech space,\" he said.\n\nAccording to tech site Layoffs.fyi, nearly 194,000 industry employees have lost their jobs in the US since the beginning of 2022, not including those announced by Alphabet on Friday.\n\nHewlett Packard and cloud computing giant Salesforce also announced major cuts this month, as rampant inflation and rising interest rates have slowed growth.",
